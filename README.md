# Team 6 CMPE 202 Project Fall 2023

## Team Members: Aishwarya Shankar, Sai Pranavi Kurapati, Sayali Vinod Bayaskar, Divija Choudhary

### Name of Application: MovieAnytime
### Tech Stack Used
+ Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
+ Backend: Python Flask Framework
+ Database: PostgreSQL

Rationale behind tech stack decision: Since we are dealing with structured data for this this application, a relational database made sense to use. Most team members were overall familar with PostgreSQL, so we chose to use that. Team members were also familiar with Python programming, and Flask framework makes it easy to create routes/endpoints so we decided to use this for backend. Our team decided to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend as we had not extensively worked with any frontend frameworks prior to this project, so we decided to keep it simple.
