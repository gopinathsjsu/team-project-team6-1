# Our Team's XP Core Values Reflection
***
## 1. Feedback
In extreme programming, receiving timely and constructive feedback is extremely important. Our team certainly followed this and used it to drive and improve our work. We always made sure to take feedback, insight, and ideas from each other on the code that we worked on, keeping in mind that there may be ways to improve the code that we, individually, had not thought of yet. We kept an open mind, listened to each other, and incorporated each other's ideas to make the final product something that all of us are proud of.

## 2. Respect
Respect is a fundamental pillar of extreme programming and something that is key to making any project successful. In our team, we always maintained care and respect for each other and the work that we put into the project. We made sure to consider each of our viewpoints, ideas, and schedules to ensure that everyone was able to participate to the fullest extent possible. Each of us also made sure to take accountability for the code that we wrote, knowing that
we had to deliver it in a sincere and timely manner so that it would not cause any hindrances to our teammates. Doing all of these things kept our project progressing smoothly.
